                <p>
                Hello, I'm Hrushi, a passionate Computer Science enthusiast. My journey as a software developer 
                commenced during my undergraduate program in India, culminating in a Bachelor's of Technology 
                in Computer Science. 
                <br/>
                Throughout this academic journey, I maintained a steadfast commitment to continuous learning 
                and skill development, all with the goal of shaping a successful career.
                <br/>
                Upon completing my undergraduate program, I pursued my ambition further and recently achieved 
                a Master's degree in Computer Science from NYU, solidifying my expertise in the field. This 
                journey has equipped me with a strong foundation and a wealth of knowledge, and I'm eager to 
                leverage these experiences to contribute effectively to the world of technology.
                <br/>
                âœ¨My aspirations
                <br/>
                - I believe technology is the future, and it transforms our lives every day in some way or another. 
                Therefore, I want to be part of this evolving tech world and change the lives of people.
                <br/>
                - I want to be working on challenging things with people smarter than me. I want to keep 
                learning and growing both my technical and interpersonal skills so that I can strive to be 
                the most successful version of myself.
                <br/>
